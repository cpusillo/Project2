# Herbizzle

This was a group project for school. It is essentially a personal blog. 

I was responsible for the backend development of the application, this is a Node.JS centric class:
* Database structure and setup, usage within the program.
* User authentication with Passport.js and bcrypt. 
* Project ORM, using and manipulating the data stored in our databases. Using MySQL and Sequelize.
* Managed the functionality of user posts, and tieing those posts to user accounts.
* All api and html routing, fetching user data and making it readable from the UI.
* Designed the user dashboard screen.
* Responsible for setting the project up on Heroku with a hosted database (JawsDB).
